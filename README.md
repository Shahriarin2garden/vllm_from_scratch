# vllm_from_scratch
**nano‑vLLM**: A step‑by‑step architectural lab guide with enhanced visuals to explore vLLM inefficiencies. Learn how GPU underutilization (60–70% idle), memory fragmentation (30–50% waste), poor throughput (1 request/iteration), and high latency (long requests blocking others) impact performance—and experiment with solutions.
